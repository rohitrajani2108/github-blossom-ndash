# github-blossom-integration
This repository tests integration between github and blossom as part of an end-to-end test for integration with NDash.

By creating a branch, then opening a PR, and commenting `/blossom-ci` on the PR, it will trigger Github Actions that will perform duo authentication before proceeding with CI tests.
